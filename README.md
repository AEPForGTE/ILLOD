# ILLOD
This git repo provides data and evaluation results from our research in abbreviation-expansion pair detection for glossary term extraction (AEPForGTE). It is intended to support the process of glossary creation for requirement specifications. It also provides an implementation of ILLOD.

ILLOD is a binary classifier for abbreviation-expansion detection. It checks for two given terms whether they are compatible as abbreviation-expansion pair. It extends the algorithm of [1], that we re-implemented in Python to make it usable for cross-comparisons, where abbreviations and possible expansions appear in different sentences/ requirements. ILLOD checks initial letters, term lengths, order, and distribution of characters.

ILLOD is a feature based classifier and proves to be more accurate than approaches based on syntactic or semantic similarity. Therefore it can beneficially extend term clustering tools for synonym detection.
