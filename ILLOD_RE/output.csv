772;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must support structured data entry for common forms and fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization. A standardized data structure ensures that data mapping of common elements will only be necessary one time, rather than for each event.;{}
773;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should support multiple deployment options (e.g., client server, disconnected, and potentially web based).;{}
774;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should provide the ability for comp in disconnected mode to reconnect to a server to share OM data among other comp that operate in disconnected mode.;{'computer': 'comp'}
775;07_phin;OM data should be synchronized so that all instances of OM applications working from the same server are able to share and use the same data.;{}
776;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should be able to electronically record and store data from remote devices that may be uploaded to an aggregating system.;{}
777;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, domain-specific vocabulary.;{}
778;07_phin;The following high-level data requirements are necessary to ensure that the data being collected, analyzed, and reported to support OM are clearly defined.;{}
779;07_phin;An entity is any being or object involved in a health event. Entities may be classified as a person, organization, location, animal, object, conveyance, event, or other organism. Each type of entity requires specific data to be collected.;{}
780;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture demographic data about persons involved in an OM investigation, including: Subject ID, name, address, date of birth, gender, phone number, race, ethnicity, and country of citizenship.;{}
781;07_phin;Other descriptive details may be captured, such as occupation and work history.;{}
782;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about organizations (e.g., a local health department, a university, a professional association) involved in an OM investigation, including: organization name, location, and contact information.;{}
783;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about locations involved in an OM investigation, including: name (if applicable), type (e.g., floor, building, room, store), street address, city, state, zip code, country, GPS coordinates, and other specific details (e.g., a specific building on a campus, a business branch location, a local chapter’s meeting hall);{}
784;07_phin;"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any animals involved in an OM investigation, including: type (dog, monkey, etc), age, gender, owner’s name and address, color, weight, and species. A Subject ID should also be collected for animals in an OM investigation. It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in Inv may need to be tagged.";{'investigation': 'Inv'}
785;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data for Obj involved in an OM investigation, such as a letter, invoice, food item, or Obj that cannot be classified as a “person, organization, place, or animal.” Collected data may include: name of the object, type, physical descriptors, address, id number (e.g. serial number, package slip number), and relevant dates and times (e.g., invoice date, shipping date, packaging date).;{'identification number': 'id number'}
786;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any conveyance involved in an OM investigation, including: type of conveyance, route taken (e.g., flight number), etc.;{}
787;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball game) involved in an OM investigation, including: time, location, nature of the event, etc.;{}
788;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any living things other than persons or animals that are involved in an OM investigation, including: type of living thing, and other customizable data collection questions.;{}
789;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture an entity’s travel history to support investigations of Ent infected, exposed or potentially exposed.;{'entity': 'Ent'}
790;07_phin;When a health event is investigated, it must be assigned an event identifier (i.e., Event ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.;{}
791;07_phin;Data describing the health event should be captured, including the reason for the investigation, the category of event (e.g. environmental, infectious), the date the event began, the suspected agent (if known) or investigation focus, the geographic area impacted by the event, as well as the event status (e.g., open, closed).;{}
792;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should have the ability to record the case definition for a health event.;{}
793;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should have the ability to capture changes to the case definition that occur as the health event evolves.;{}
794;07_phin;Travel history provides specific information to indicate when, where, and how subjects involved in an event traveled to a location (or to multiple locations), and conveyance data describes the vehicle in which the travel occurred. Examples of travel history include a person’s local travel as a part of their daily activities as well as the shipment of animals or plants from one country to another.;{}
795;07_phin;Travel history data should include information such as the method of transportation (e.g. bus, plane, boat, car), flight number, departure and arrival dates and times, and the origination and destination locations (city, state, and country).;{}
796;07_phin;Information about each leg of a trip, as well as the parent information about the trip, should be captured. For example, if a person who lives in Georgia travels to Seattle and becomes exposed to monkey pox, then visits a friend in Santa Fe, travel history and conveyance data should be noted accordingly for each place the exposed person traveled.;{}
797;07_phin;Travel history data to be collected for an animal or object should include shipping invoices, animal shelter delivery and adoption receipts, and delivery schedules (including delivery vehicle and driver information).;{}
798;07_phin;Detailed conveyance data must be collected when relevant to the investigation, including the carrier identifier, the type of conveyance (such as airplane, bus, or train, among countless others), as well as the make, model, year, and identification number (e.g., VIN) of each vehicle with which the entity was in Cont (if this information is relevant to the investigation).;{'contact': 'Cont'}
799;07_phin;Case and exposure data provide more detailed information beyond demographic data. Cases can be persons or animals, and exposure contacts can be persons, animals, other organisms, or exposure settings, such as travel conveyance, location, organization, Obj, or event.;{'object': 'Obj'}
800;07_phin;Because attr of both case and exposure data may describe the same entity, systems supporting OM must have the ability to avoid capturing redundant entity demographic information.;{'attribute': 'attr'}
801;07_phin;Case data about the entity should include: a case identifier (i.e., Case ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction being reported, the suspected agent, case diagnosis, health status (e.g., no symptoms, acute illness), case status (e.g., confirmed, probable, suspect), investigation dates, clinical history, symptom onset date and time, epidemiological links to other cases, and priority (e.g., high, medium, low).;{}
802;07_phin;There must be a means to update the case diagnosis either manually or automatically if the case definition changes during evt.;{'event': 'evt'}
803;07_phin;Epidemiological (epi) data must be collected to assist in the case investigation of events. Standard epi data to be collected includes: onset date and time of symptoms, type of symptoms, risk factors, medical history data, laboratory data, procedure data, and questionnaire responses.;{}
804;07_phin;Systems supporting OM must allow for dynamic, event-specific case investigation data to be captured.;{}
805;07_phin;In the context of a case, all entities exposed to a case must be recorded and linked to the case.;{}
806;07_phin;Demographic information should be collected about the investigator, including their name, address, and contact information, so that the investigator may be contacted to answer questions or to provide additional information.;{}
807;07_phin;Both the jurisdiction investigating the event and the jurisdiction reporting the cases and associated investigations must be captured. For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited.;{}
808;07_phin;Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls. For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation.;{}
809;07_phin;Exposure investigation data to be captured must include information related to exposure levels, type of exposure (e.g., intimate, social, household, common conveyance), place of exposure, length of time Ent was exposed, frequency of exposure, and Ent’s proximity to the source of exposure.;{'entity': 'Ent'}

1327;08_eirene;A visual and audible alarm shall be given when the remaining capacity of the battery is such as to enable only 10 minutes of full duplex call time.;{}
1328;08_eirene;A visual indication shall be provided to the user if the network service is no longer available.;{}
1329;08_eirene;An audible indication should be provided to the user if the network service is no longer available.;{}
1330;08_eirene;Within a railway operational structure there may be several different controller types such as primary, power, secondary, etc.;{}
1331;08_eirene;"These may be physically separate or co- located; however, the majority of interaction is with the primary controller.";{}
1332;08_eirene;Detailed specification of controller equipment and the interface between such equipment and the EIRENE network is at the discretion of the railway operator.;{}
1333;08_eirene;Within a control centres equipment, the radio control functions and presentation may be integrated within a set of equipment used for other control operations.;{}
1334;08_eirene;Details concerning controller equipment requirements for Railway emergency calls are given in section 13.;{}
1335;08_eirene;The primary controllers MMI should provide the following functionality: Queue all incoming calls or call requests.;{}
1336;08_eirene;Display the queue to the controller, showing the functional identity and priority of callers.;{}
1337;08_eirene;High priority calls should be identified and presented at the top of the queue.;{}
1338;08_eirene;Allow the controller to select any of the incoming calls currently queued by the system.;{}
1339;08_eirene;Allow the controller to establish a call of Railway emergency, public emergency or railway operation priority to any mobile by selection from the display.;{}
1340;08_eirene;Allow the controller to establish, close, enter and leave group calls (at Railway emergency, public emergency or railway operation priority).;{}
1341;08_eirene;Allow sending and receiving of text messages.;{}
1342;08_eirene;For post incident analysis, the controller equipment should provide the possibility to record all operational speech and data calls.;{}
1343;08_eirene;It should be possible for calls to be answered automatically according to incoming call priority as defined in section.;{}
1344;08_eirene;The functionality required by other types of controllers is essentially the same as for primary controllers, but CTA will differ and the call set-up subsystem may be integrated into their own function management system.;{'control area': 'CTA'}
1345;08_eirene;At the detailed level, different controllers may have specific addressing needs, eg catering controllers will need to call specific vehicles in a train.;{}
1346;08_eirene;The communications architecture will be dictated by local circumstances. The definition of this interface is beyond the scope of EIRENE.;{}
1347;08_eirene;The controller equipment must be designed to function correctly in a railway operating environment, such as control centres and signal boxes.;{}
1348;08_eirene;International standardisation of numbering plans is needed to ensure interworking between networks. Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers will facilitate schemes for identification, barring, etc.;{}
1349;08_eirene;"This section addresses the following: numbering plan requirements; standardised telephone numbers; group numbers; calls from external networks to the EIRENE network.";{}
1350;08_eirene;The EIRENE system shall enable users to originate and receive calls by functional number.;{}
1351;08_eirene;Each mobile shall be identified by a unique telephone number.;{}
1352;08_eirene;The use of train numbers to address trains shall not result in any ambiguities.;{}
1353;08_eirene;Every on-train function shall be identified by a unique standard number.;{}
1354;08_eirene;The use of engine/coach numbers to address trains shall not result in any ambiguities.;{}
1355;08_eirene;Every on-engine/coach function shall be identified by a unique standard number.;{}
1356;08_eirene;"Every shunting team number shall be based on an association of: service area identifier; shunting team identifier.";{}
1357;08_eirene;"Every maintenance team number shall be based on an association of: service area identifier; type of maintenance team (speciality code); maintenance team identifier.";{}
1358;08_eirene;"Every controller number shall be based on an association of: controller location; controller identifier.";{}
1359;08_eirene;The numbering for other teams shall be treated in the same way as maintenance teams in.;{}

1361;08_eirene;In some countries, train numbers are alphanumeric. Support for such numbers is not required for interoperability.;{}
1362;08_eirene;Telephone numbers can be defined on a national basis, but codes for certain functions shall be used on an international basis in order to allow interoperability.;{}
1363;08_eirene;"For certain functions, standardised telephone numbers shall be implemented. These functions are:  - Route call to most appropriate ERTMS/ETCS RBC; - Railway emergency call; - Route call to primary controller; - Route call to secondary controller; - Route call to power supply controller; - Public emergency call.";{}
1364;08_eirene;To provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the EIRENE network, standardisation of UIC group numbering will be required.;{}

1366;08_eirene;Authorised users within the EIRENE network shall be able to receive calls from calling parties outside the EIRENE network.;{}
1367;08_eirene;In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, in particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information stored in the network.;{}

1372;08_eirene;The lowest priority ongoing call shall be pre-empted before that of a higher priority.;{}
1373;08_eirene;In the case where an EIRENE mobile attempts to make a Railway emergency call over a public network, the ability to pre-empt lower priority calls (particularly public emergency calls) may be inhibited, unless a special agreement is in place.;{}
1374;08_eirene;Various types of call restriction may be employed by the railways as an additional security measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of PUB calling drivers and drivers calling members of PUB).;{'public': 'PUB'}

1376;08_eirene;A mobile may be a member of No of groups. It shall be possible to activate or deactivate the mobiles subscription to these groups.;{'number': 'No'}
1377;08_eirene;Activating a group on the mobile shall allow a user to receive a call from that group.;{}
1378;08_eirene;Deactivating a group on the mobile shall prevent a user receiving calls from that group.;{}

1389;08_eirene;There is a requirement to be able to address comm to a functional number rather than a telephone number. Such numbers are generally only associated with a user for a limited period of time.;{'communication': 'comm'}
1390;08_eirene;"The addressing scheme can be divided into two areas: functional addressing; location dependent addressing.";{}
1391;08_eirene;An addressing scheme shall be provided which permits users to be identified by numbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to the terminal equipment that they are using.;{}
1392;08_eirene;The primary usage of functional addressing will be for controllers to establish communications with train drivers by making use of the train number. The train number will vary between journeys although EIRENE equipment in the cab is unlikely to change.;{}
1393;08_eirene;Other uses of functional addressing will include identifying on-train functions and other users performing particular roles such as shunting team leaders, maintenance team members, etc.;{}
1394;08_eirene;It shall be possible to assign up to a minimum of 3 functional numbers to an EIRENE user at any one time.;{}
1395;08_eirene;Only one EIRENE user shall be assigned to a given functional number at any one time.;{}
1396;08_eirene;A user shall be able to set up a functional number on one network, and cancel the number from another network.;{}
1397;08_eirene;The functional number shall remain valid as a user roams from one network to another.;{}
1398;08_eirene;The functional addressing scheme shall be independent of specific configurations of mobile and terminal equipment. For example, the functional number of a conductor on board a particular train shall be the same irrespective of whether the conductor accesses the network through the Cab radio or has a separate dedicated EIRENE mobile.;{}
1399;08_eirene;It shall be possible to call EIRENE users by functional numbers from a wide range of terminals (EIRENE and non-EIRENE). Examples include EIRENE mobiles, controller terminals, railway fixed network telephones and public telephones. (All such calls will be subject to any access restrictions see section .);{}
1400;08_eirene;The functional addressing scheme should permit calls to be routed from a controller to an international train within the control area without ref to any EIRENE system other than that providing svc to the international train.;{'service': 'svc'}
1401;08_eirene;Functional numbers must be unique within the domain of operation. Since the number must be independent of networks, each number must be unique across all networks (including impl. of EIRENE facilities on public networks).;{'implementation': 'impl.'}
1402;08_eirene;The functional number shall consist of numeric characters only.;{}
1403;08_eirene;If alphanumeric numbers are applied by a national railway, rlW will be responsible for the translation to unique numeric functional numbers compatible with the EIRENE specification.;{'railway': 'rlW'}
1404;08_eirene;The functional identity of the called user shall be presented to the user initiating a call and the functional identity of the initiator shall be presented to the user receiving a call.;{}
1405;08_eirene;For broadcast and group voice communications, the functional identity provided shall be that of the broadcast or group identity.;{}
1406;08_eirene;If the user initiating the call has more than one functional identity, the user shall be able to select, prior to call establishment, which functional identity is presented to the receiving user.;{}
1407;08_eirene;In the case of Cab radio, when a train number is assigned as a functional identity, this shall take priority over other Cab radio functional identities, and shall be the functional identity for the Cab radio to be displayed to other users.;{}
1408;08_eirene;The functional identity shall be presented to the user in a form which can be readily understood (eg driver of train abcd rather than abcd01 or xyz shunting team 3 rather than xyz03).;{}
1409;08_eirene;Three procedures can be identified for managing the relationship between the functional number and the telephone number by the mobile user as defined below.;{}
1410;08_eirene;The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straightforward procedure for registration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the user on commencement of the functional role.;{}
1411;08_eirene;The functional number registration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user equipment.;{}
1412;08_eirene;"It should be possible for the system to prevent certain types of users from registering functional numbers that they are not authorised to use, for example: train number; driver of train; shunting team leader.";{}
1413;08_eirene;It shall be possible to register up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment physically connected to the Cab radio within 30s.;{'30 second': '30s'}

1415;08_eirene;Duplicate functional numbers (eg two trains with the same train number) shall be prevented.;{}
1416;08_eirene;The system shall provide a means to recover consistent data sets following a system failure during which functional addressing facilities are lost. During this recovery period, the system shall not permit the use of unverified functional numbers.;{}
1417;08_eirene;The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straightforward procedure for deregistration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the user at the end of the functional role.;{}
1418;08_eirene;The functional number deregistration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user equipment.;{}
1419;08_eirene;It shall be possible to deregister up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds.;{}
1420;08_eirene;"In addition, a given set of users shall also be allowed to: deregister a functional number which is no longer valid but which has not been deregistered by the user; deregister, by overriding, another user of the same type (eg a driver can deregister a train number that another driver has forgotten to deregister); deregister, with one action, all functional numbers associated with the same mobile (eg the driver deregisters all functions at the end of the journey).";{}
1421;08_eirene;An EIRENE mobile shall remove the displayed functional number and provide an indication to the user that deregistration has taken place.;{}
1422;08_eirene;To allow roaming between EIRENE networks, the system shall support a procedure for the re-registration of functional numbers after sel of a new network.;{'selection': 'sel'}
1423;08_eirene;This procedure shall be carried out without manual intervention.;{}
1424;08_eirene;After automatic re-registration is performed, the new registration details shall be displayed to the user.;{}
1425;08_eirene;Location dependent addressing shall be provided to route calls for a given function to a destination number that is dependent upon the users location.;{}
1426;08_eirene;"The functions to which calls shall be routed based upon the location of the mobile shall include: Primary controller; Secondary controller; Power supply controller; Train management centre (eg RBC, CTS).";{}
1427;08_eirene;The correspondence between the locations and the destination of the call shall be easily re-configurable to support dynamic changes in controller area boundaries (eg controller area boundaries will change from peak to off-peak periods during the working day or over longer periods, areas may change to match changes in railway organisation or traffic demand).;{}
1428;08_eirene;When operating with location dependent addressing, no manual action shall be required to update the system when a mobile moves between locations.;{}
1429;08_eirene;The location dependent addressing scheme shall be available to all mobiles.;{}
1430;08_eirene;As a minimum, the location information used by the EIRENE system shall be derived from that available from the network itself (eg current cell or base station serving the mobile).;{}
1431;08_eirene;"Where greater accuracy for location dependent addressing is required, additional location information may be provided by systems external to EIRENE. src of such information may include:  a) ground-based signalling systems; b) on-train systems (eg ERTMS/ETCS equipment, balise readers, GPS etc).";{'source': 'src'}
1432;08_eirene;There is a requirement that the EIRENE system can be used as a bearer to support an application connected to the radio for exchange of text messages between ground and mobile(s) or mobile and ground.;{}

1437;08_eirene;If a message is safety related, the safety mechanisms will be included at the application level and do not concern the EIRENE system.;{}
1438;08_eirene;The maximum length of a message segment shall be 96 characters. A message can include several segments.;{}

1708;10_peering;The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with o. cdn.;{'other cdn': 'o. cdn'}
1709;10_peering;The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.;{}
1710;10_peering;The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web server’s resources (e.g. CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced.;{}
1711;10_peering;The Web servers’ underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.;{}
1712;10_peering;The Mediator generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.;{}
1713;10_peering;The Mediator passes the service requirements to the PA.;{}
1714;10_peering;The Mediator works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.;{}
1715;10_peering;Once a peering arrangement is established, the Mediator controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e. end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used.;{}
1716;10_peering;The Mediator ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience);{}
1717;10_peering;The Service Registry encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN.;{}
1718;10_peering;The Service Registry helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.;{}
1719;10_peering;In the face of traffic surges, the Service Registry supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.;{}
1720;10_peering;When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.;{}
1721;10_peering;The Policy Repository virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement.;{}
1722;10_peering;The Policy Repository provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement.;{}
1723;10_peering;The Policy Repository returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements.;{}
1724;10_peering;A Peering Agent acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations.;{}
1725;10_peering;A Peering Agent exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs.;{}
1726;10_peering;A Peering Agent is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them.;{}
1727;10_peering;Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data. Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute;{}
1728;10_peering;Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e. mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or thresholdbased manner. The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers;{}
1729;10_peering;Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels – at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster. Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.;{}

1737;10_peering;In the face of traffic surges, information on available local resources along withtheir IDs is supplied to the Mediator.;{}
1738;10_peering;Local and delegated external resource information is encapsulated in the SR instance in the established peering arrangement.;{}

1765;10_peering;If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service requirements are not passed to the local PA.;{}
1766;10_peering;Operational Management is responsible for the inter-CDN protocol configuration, resource initialization and for ensuring effective operations of the established peering arrangement.;{}
1767;10_peering;External PA: Exchanges configurations and content availability information, and accepts requests to an optimal peer. PR: Assists in enforcing negotiated policies.;{}
1768;10_peering;Once policies are negotiated and a peering arrangement is established, PAs interact each other in the execution of common goal(s).;{}
