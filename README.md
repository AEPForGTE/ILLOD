# ILLOD: A Tool for Abbreviation-Expansion Pair Detection<br> in Natural Language Requirements

This repository provides methods (python sources), data, and evaluation results for the detection 
of abbreviation-expansion pairs (AEPs) in requirement sets, specifically for glossary term 
extraction and consolidation in requirement documents. 
This includes the identification of potential abbreviations with various styles in the requirements texts.
For AEP detection, the ILLOD(+) tool identifies 
if a term is a potential long form to a given abbreviation
based on syntactic features of both terms, i.a. **I**nitial **L**etters, term **L**engths, **O**rder, and **D**istribution of characters.

## Description
### Summary 
This repository includes data and methods (python sources) to run the following steps:

1) **Create a test data-set:** Replace long-form terms in a requirement set with abbreviations from predefined lists to create a modified 
requirement set.


2) **Replicate Evaluation:** Execute and evaluate different classifiers for AEP detection, using the modified 
requirement set based on the analysis of AEP group creation (clusters that link a single 
abbreviation with all the potential expansions associated with that abbreviation).


3) **Use ILLOD for custom data-set:** Optionally, extract AEP groups from a user-specified file.

Step (1) aims to simulate a scenario where the requirement set has a large number of undefined and uncontrolled
abbreviations, thereby representing a requirements set of weak quality.
The data provided consists of 1934 requirements from the [PURE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8049173) dataset and a list of abbreviations for a subset of 518 terms extracted from those. The abbreviations are suggested by different persons in an uncontrolled way. 
An automated routine can be used to replace random long-form terms from the list with the corresponding abbreviations and create a testset that contains requirements with long and short forms respectively.
Such a dataset was used for the experiments on requirements texts presented in [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584923000575) and can be generated for replication.
Where to find the respective files in the repository structure is described below.
In addition, the *ILLOD_REFSQ* subdirectory contains with *insertedAbbreviations.txt* a shorter list of 30 AEPs and with *Promise_constructed.CSV* a data-set where these long forms where replaced manually in requirements from the [PROMISE NFR dataset](http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/RE2017/downloads/datasets/nfr.arff) for the pilot experiment in [[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98464-9_6).
Further, both publication specific subdirectories contain *abbr_db.CSV* a list of 1786 AEPs from the field of information technology ((https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/acronyms.htm)), which was used for initial abbreviation detection optimization and to generate a synthetic data-set of AEPs hidden in unrelated text. 
 

Step (2) is the evaluation to assess the performance of different classifiers in detecting AEPs on a modified requirement data-set:
- LD (based on Levenshtein-Distance)
- JWS (based on Jaroâ€“Winkler-Similarity)
- DC (based on Dice-Coefficient)
- FT (based on [FastText](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00051)) --- not included to main experiment
- ILLOD
- ILLOD+ A (ILLOD with recursive calls and extended character distribution analysis)
- ILLOD+ B (ILLOD+ A with syllable analysis)

In all cases this includes the same method to detect abbreviation candidates in the texts. (The version in *ILLOD_REFSQ* is simpler and does not cover small caps forms and bi-grams)

The following parameter are evaluated
- Number of AEP groups (abbreviations with at least one expansion candidate)
- Number of missed abbreviations (detection recall)
- Number of found abbreviations (inserted abbreviations with own AEP group)
- Number of matched abbreviations (total recall)
- Size of AEP groups
- Cost Effectiveness
- Duration of execution

Simple precision and recall can only be calculated for the synthetic dataset, where all true and false positive assignments are known and no additional "noise" abbreviations or expansion candidates come from other parts of the text. Here, the FastText-based classifier is included to the experiments, but shows long execution time and poor performance (c.f. *5) Section_6.4 -- Table_3.ipynb*) in the publication specific sub-directories).

Step (3) allows to use ILLOD for other datasets. For this, the user-specified file must be csv-formatted and contain the columns "ID" and "requirement", which are separated by a semicolon ";". 
This file has to be placed in the input_data folder.

git clone https://github.com/AEPForGTE/ILLOD
```
Navigate to the MAIN directory:
```sh
cd MAIN
```

Create a new virtual environment for the project:
```sh
python3 -m venv illod_venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```sh
source illod_venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```

Navigate to the root folder:
```sh
cd ..

Run the main&#46;py script to generate the output files:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Steps to Reproduce on Windows
To reproduce the results presented in the paper [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584923000575), follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AEPForGTE/ILLOD
```
Navigate to the MAIN directory:
```sh
cd MAIN
```

Create a new virtual environment for the project:
```sh
python -m venv illod_venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```sh
.\illod_venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements_win.txt
```
Navigate to the root folder:
```sh
cd ..
```

Run the main&#46;py script to generate the output files:
```sh
python main.py
```


### Results

Running main&#46;py executes 3 subroutines.

- The first function generates a modified version of the requirements data by replacing some terms 
  with their corresponding abbreviations. By default, the main routine replaces 100 long forms with abbreviations. This value can be changed by modifying the NUM_OF_REPLACEMENTS variable in main.py. Note that only values between 0 and 400 are allowed.

- The second function runs the ten fold validation function with the NUM_OF_REPLACEMENTS parameter 
  to evaluate the performance of ILLOD on the modified requirements data. 

- Finally, the third function checks whether an additional file for AEP detection is stored in the 
  input_data folder. It writes the list of detected AEP groups (Abbreviation Expansion Pairs) into the file "found_AEP_groups.json". 


After running main&#46;py, two new output files are created in the MAIN/output directory. Optionally, a third file is generated when an additional file for AEP detection is placed in the input_data folder by the user.

| FILE                            | DESCRIPTION |
|---------------------------------| ------ |
| pure_modified_requirements.csv  | A CSV file containing 1934 requirements from PURE dataset, where a given number of randomly chosen terms (long forms) were replaced by uncontrolled abbreviations (short forms).|
| evaluation_results.csv          | A CSV file containing detailed evaluation results showing how the ILLOD approach performed on detecting the inserted abbreviations.|
| Optional: found_AEP_groups.json | JSON-encoded file that contains detected AEP groups from the additional file. |

As substituted long forms are randomly choosen, the actual result values differ from those presented in [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584923000575). However, the general average performance over several runs should remain comparable.
Values as presented in the paper can be found in the respective notebooks within the paper specific sub-directories, together with those for the syntetic experiment.
Yet, again, if executed again, values based on random selections will change in these notebooks, too.
