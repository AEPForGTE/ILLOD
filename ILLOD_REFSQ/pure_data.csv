08_eirene	1454	If the system is not able to connect the call, the system shall automatically keep trying to connect the call for 30 seconds.
08_eirene	1455	During this period the user shall be provided with an audible and visual indication that the system is trying to connect the call.
08_eirene	1456	After the 30 second period, if the connection was unsuccessful, the system shall provide another audible and visual indication that it was unable to connect the call.
08_eirene	1457	An audible indication of 5 seconds (to be confirmed by trials) shall be provided to originating and receiving users that the emergency function has been activated.

08_eirene	1479	During specific shunting operations where the driver is not able to see the way ahead and where he is therefore relying on information from another shunting member, a link assurance signal is needed to provide reassurance during silent periods that the radio link is still established. This signal is also employed to provide reassurance that this other shunting member is not incapacitated.
08_eirene	1480	The shunting call shall be a group call and shall have Railway operation priority (see section ).
08_eirene	1481	Throughout the duration of the shunting group call, it shall be possible for any member of the shunting group to speak to all other members of the group, using the PTT function (as described in sections ,  and ), except during transmission of the link assurance signal.
08_eirene	1482	During the transmission of the link assurance signal, only the originator of the link assurance signal shall be able to speak to all other members using the PTT function.
08_eirene	1483	The shunting communication shall be protected from unintentional and unauthorised access.
08_eirene	1484	It shall be possible for all mobile members of the shunting group (except the driver) to transmit a link assurance signal.

08_eirene	1486	Operational radios used for shunting shall enable the link assurance signal to be activated and de-activated by the shunting group member.
08_eirene	1487	The link assurance signal should be used to reassure the driver of the integrity of the member at the head of the shunting movement.
08_eirene	1488	Operational radios used for shunting shall be able to be switched between the following two operating modes by a maintenance function: Mode 1: the member is required to continuously press the link assurance signal button in order to transmit the link assurance signal; Mode 2: the member is required to switch on the link assurance signal and then periodically press a button in order to transmit the link assurance signal (failure to do so shall result in the deactivation of the link assurance signal after a predefined period has elapsed).
08_eirene	1489	The link assurance signal shall be used to provide an audible indication to all group members. For the driver, this indicates that the radio link is operational.
08_eirene	1490	It shall be possible for any member of the shunting group (including a driver) to transmit a shunting emergency call to all shunting groups in the area.
08_eirene	1491	It shall be possible for all shunting drivers and shunting group members to receive a shunting emergency call from any equipment capable of taking part in shunting communications. The shunting emergency call shall cause the audible link assurance signal to be interrupted.

08_eirene	1494	If the radio is used by the team leader for a shunting group call (ie initiated the shunting group call), switching the radio off shall result in the termination of the shunting group call.
08_eirene	1495	A shunting group shall be able to consist of the following mobile members: the shunting leader; the shunting driver, who may remain fixed (ie in a shunting area) or may change one or more times during a working period (ie passenger or freight stations); up to three shunting team members.
08_eirene	1496	In addition to the above shunting group members: a controller shall be able to be associated permanently or temporarily with the shunting group; a shunting manager or other person capable of taking part in a shunting communication should be able to be temporarily associated with the shunting group.
08_eirene	1497	It shall only be possible for the shunting leader to communicate with a person external to the ongoing shunting communication. This may be initiated by either the shunting leader or the external user. In the latter case, in order to avoid disturbing a shunting movement, the shunting leader should be informed by a visual and audible indication. The shunting leader can then choose the moment when he takes or rejects the call.
08_eirene	1498	The shunting leader shall then be able to allow the external user to join the shunting communication.
08_eirene	1504	This means will consist of an additional safety device (external to the radio system) interposed between the Cab radio and the loudspeaker with the purpose of muting the continuous link assurance signal for the drivers convenience. In this case, the safety device will alert the driver only if the link assurance signal has failed or if it is cancelled.
08_eirene	1505	Operational radios used for shunting shall be able to be switched between the following two operating modes by a maintenance function: Mode A: the link assurance signal shall be interrupted, but not cancelled, when the initiator of the link assurance signal presses the PTT to speak.

10_peering	1710	The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web server’s resources (e.g. CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced.
10_peering	1711	The Web servers’ underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.
10_peering	1717	The Service Registry encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN.
10_peering	1718	The Service Registry helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.
10_peering	1719	In the face of traffic surges, the Service Registry supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.
10_peering	1720	When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.
10_peering	1721	The Policy Repository virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement.

10_peering	1727	Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data. Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute
10_peering	1728	Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e. mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or thresholdbased manner. The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers
10_peering	1731	Service registration is triggered when either one of the following occurs: (a) resources are available as a provider starts operating; (b) previously registered resource information needs to be updated; (c) available local resource information is required in the event of traffic surges; and (d) local and delegated external resource information is to be encapsulated in an SR instance included in an established peering arrangement.
10_peering	1732	Available local resources of a CDN provider are detected along with their service information such as CPU, storage, upload and download rate, etc. These resources could be provisioned and reserved to satisfy SLAs.
10_peering	1733	Resources are registered in the service registry and being updated in a regular basis.
10_peering	1734	Each CDN Web server publishes resource and service information.
10_peering	1735	If it is a new resource, its service information is registered in the SR with a new resource ID. Resource ID counter is incremented.
10_peering	1736	Else, resource information in SR is updated in a regular basis.
10_peering	1737	In the face of traffic surges, information on available local resources along withtheir IDs is supplied to the Mediator.
10_peering	1739	If a resource fails, its service information is removed from SR and the resource ID counter is decremented.
10_peering	1749	The Trigger is invoked when a (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of theworkload on its WS(s). The triggering condition considers the expected andunexpected load increases in the initiating (primary) CDN.
10_peering	1750	If the user requests experience service timeout (threshold), initiation request is cancelled.
10_peering	1752	Upon receiving the initialization request to trigger peering, the mediator generates service requirements and passes it to local PA.
10_peering	1773	The policy repository instance in the established peering arrangement assists in the deployment, administration and enforcement of the functional policies.
